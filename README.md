# Hello,

My name is Rafael (Rafa) Zoldan, I’m a Software Developer with three years of experience in modern Front End and Back End programming languages and managing projects in fast-paced environments.

Over the past three years, I have built robust front end apps and managed their back end with top-of-the-line technologies and frameworks such as Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS, React, Svelte, TailwindCss, GraphQL, MongoDB, Webpack, Vite, Firebase, HTML5, SaaS, CSS3.

I’m well-versed in Agile methodology, Git, and creating and maintaining custom web and mobile applications.

A portfolio of my work can be found here: [https://rafazoldan.com](https://rafazoldan.com)

Prior to software engineering, I worked in the ad tech space for about a decade. This included co-founding a company that grew to employ 140 people at its peak and gave me invaluable insights into growth needs, management, leadership, and resourcefulness.
